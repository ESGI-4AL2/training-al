## Description
- Objects encapsulation issues for testing

## Notes
- Position is a ValueObject
- Player has a state position and it is exposed through the currentPosition() method
- Testing the player object has drawbacks
    - using the currentPosition() method
    - wrapping the Position object by creating a new current Player object
